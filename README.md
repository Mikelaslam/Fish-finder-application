## Project set up

After identifying the appropriate api for our project, we start by creating a private repository in Github. In this case I used an api () from _rapidapi.com_ Clone the repository to the local folder and using _touch_ , create a README.md, index.js, index.html and style.css file. Another option is creating the files from the VS Code. Once we are done creating tyhe files, we run _code ._ in the terminal to open in VS Code. Our main concentrating is on the index.js file as it is the one that bears alot of work here.
